Built a weather monitoring system using an ESP32 microcontroller integrated with 8+ sensors (temperature, humidity, hall effect, and light). Developed a web dashboard for real-time data visualization, created functional prototypes with AutoCAD and 3D printing, and debugged hardware/software communication issues to ensure accurate sensor readings.
